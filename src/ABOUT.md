# About

I am a college student majoring in computer science.

And I have used Java, Go, C, C++, Rust.
But I like coding with go and rust now.

I'm just a coder; actually, I don't consider myself a programmer.

My English is not good.
But I still try to use English.

In addition, I am also learning French.

I will enhance my English proficiency and perfect this book.

### Why have this

Just because I need a place to write something down.
And I need to collect something in one place.

And I accidentally discovered that [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) is very helpful for deploying pages, especially for someone like me who isn't good at front-end development, when I started learning Rust.

There's gonna be all kinds of stuff about me.
Feel free to check it out if you're interested.
If you have any questions, please give me an issue.
